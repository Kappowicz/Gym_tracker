# Gym_tracker
Simple Gym tracker which suppose to be more intuitive than other trackers on play store.
This app won't require any data (for example any logging in) to start using, to make it as easy to use as possible.
I will also want to add here some begginer friendly tipps for some subjets related to weightlifting.

### Technologies:
It is being made on [C# .Net MAUI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/what-is-maui).
I also use third party framework to display charts [LiveCharts2](https://lvcharts.com/)
Maybe in the future there will be support for nothing glyph interface

### Platforms: 
Currently it is being made stricte for Android and Windows (for those who workout at home).
Maybe later I'll add it also to the Iphone as Apple allows downloading apps from unknown sources.

### TODO: (things to do before recognizing that the project is out of alpha)
- Creating new exercises,
- Option to add new exercises to existing workout
- Timer which starts after doing a set
- Make it prettier
- Save system

### DONE:
- Creating new workouts from existing exercises
- Doing workouts (setting exercises as done while doing workouts)
- Calculating progress based on previously saved workouts,
- Loading workouts,
- Saving done workout,

### KNOWN ISSUES:
- You can click button which opens some contentpage several times, which opens several additional contentpages
